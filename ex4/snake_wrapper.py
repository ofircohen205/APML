"""
A Snake game
A simple discrete control task. Run this file to see a random game.
The board is a 20x60 matrix. On the board there are 4 snakes (marked 1,2,3,4 - your is ‘1’),
    obstacles (marked ‘H’), and fruits (marked ‘*’, ‘$’ and 'X').
    Collision with obstacle or snake will kill your snake and it will restart itself in other place.

Each state is a 9x9 area around your snakes head, represented as one-hot vector. The state is aligned with the snake direction.

The possible actions are 0, 1, 2. o represent left, 1-forward, 2-right.

The reward is -5 for dieing and a different value for each fruit. In our version of the game the snake doesn't grow.

The game was originally created by Daniel Gissin, the previous TA. the game was changed a little this year.
